train <- read.csv("train.csv")

# From the correlation plot, almost none of the continuous variables have a strong correlation with the loss,
# but it looks like there is a good amount of correlation among the continuous variables. Multicolinearity may be a problem with these
```

```{r}
ggplot(train, aes(x = loss)) + geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick4")
train %>%
    filter(loss > 20000) %>%
    summarize(n(), n()/nrow(train))

library(e1071)
skewness(train$loss) # Positive means right skewed, negative means left skewed
# There is a large right skew to the distribution of loss. About .2% of the observations have a loss greater than 20000
box_trans <- BoxCoxTrans(train$loss)
box_trans
# With lambda estimated as 0, the best transformation is the natural log of loss

# Now it is approximately normal with a few outliers
ggplot(train, aes(x = log(loss))) + geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick4")
